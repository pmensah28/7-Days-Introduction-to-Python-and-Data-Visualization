The function header always starts with the def keyword, which indicates that this is a function definition.\n","2. Then comes the function name (here, cylinder_volume), which follows the same naming conventions as variables. You can revisit the naming conventions below.\n","3. Immediately after the name are parentheses that may include arguments separated by commas (here, height and radius). Arguments, or parameters, are values that are passed in as inputs when the function is called, and are used in the function body. If a function doesn't take arguments, these parentheses are left empty.\n","4. The header always end with a colon :.\n","<br><br>\n","\n","#### **Function Body:**\n","The rest of the function is contained in the body, which is where the function does its work.\n","\n","1. The body of a function is the code indented after the header line. Here, it's the two lines that define pi and return the volume.\n","2. Within this body, we can refer to the argument variables and define new variables, which can only be used within these indented lines.\n","3. The body will often include a return statement, which is used to send back an output value from the function to the statement that called the function. A return statement consists of the return keyword followed by an expression that is evaluated to get the output value for the function. If there is no return statement, the function simply returns None.\n","\n","\n","Below, you'll find a code editor where you can experiment with this.\n","<br><br>\n","\n","\n","#### **Naming Conventions for Functions:**\n","Function names follow the same naming conventions as variables.\n","\n","1.
